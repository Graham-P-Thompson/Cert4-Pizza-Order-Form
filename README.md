# Cert4-Pizza-Order-Form

## Description

I completed this project as part of my IT certificate 4 (programming) at Tafe in 2023.

It is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The project requirements were to create a web application that takes the number of pizzas required as input from the user and then
calculate the price of pizzas (listed below) that will be
purchased during a promotional period.

- One large pizza will cost $6.45.
- Two large pizzas will cost $12.00.
- Three large pizzas will cost $14.00.
- Four or more pizzas will use a combination of the above prices to ensure the best price for the customer. 
For example, the best price for five pizzas would be two pizzas ($12.00) + three pizzas ($14.00).

We were asked to use JSdoc to document our javascript code.
